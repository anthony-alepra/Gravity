Gravitational Simulator for Multiple Particles

This is a visual gravity simulator for many particles. It is a fun way to analytically
solve the multibody problem.

There is a large blue body in the center of the frame that attracts the
smaller particles to keep them in view, but all particles are attracted to eachother.
