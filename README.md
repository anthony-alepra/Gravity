Gravitational Simulator for Multiple Particles

This is a visual gravity simulator for many particles. It is a fun way to numerically
solve the multibody problem.

There is a large blue body in the center of the frame that attracts the
smaller particles to keep them in view, but all particles are attracted to eachother.

Download, extract the zip, navagate to dist and 
run the executable
